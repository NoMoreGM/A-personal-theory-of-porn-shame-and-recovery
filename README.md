## Abstract

This paper introduces the concept of borrowed numbness to examine the psychological and emotional mechanisms underlying compulsive pornography use. Moving beyond conventional moralistic or behavioral frameworks, we propose that porn consumption is often driven less by the pursuit of pleasure and more by the avoidance of internal discomfort. Through the lens of emotional outsourcing, we argue that individuals may unconsciously absorb the emotional detachment—particularly the submission and silence—portrayed in pornographic media, using it as a substitute for personal emotional regulation.

Drawing on psycho-social reasoning, the paper outlines how this detachment is neurologically reinforced through cycles of dopamine seeking and avoidance of emotional vulnerability. We distinguish between shame rooted in bodily acts and shame derived from the act of bypassing emotional responsibility. Furthermore, we explore how masturbation, when separated from pornographic content, becomes physically effortful and emotionally revealing—marking the beginning of true recovery.

Finally, we reframe intimacy as an active, reciprocal engagement incompatible with depersonalized consumption. Recovery is presented not as abstinence alone, but as the reconstruction of internal emotional agency, requiring awareness, effort, and honesty. The work ultimately calls for the rejection of externally sourced numbness in favor of personal emotional integrity.
